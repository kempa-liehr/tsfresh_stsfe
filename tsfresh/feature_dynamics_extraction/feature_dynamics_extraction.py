    Extract feature dynamics from a time series.
    This process involves calling `extract_features` on the original time series which produces a new set of columns - feature time series.
    Then for each of these features generated, they are again windowed and `extract_features` is called again producing a set
    of feature-dynamics or sub-features.

    The details of this function are explained in the following paper "Data Mining on Extremely Long Time Series"
    see at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9679945.

    :param timeseries_container: The pandas.DataFrame with the time series to compute the features for.
    :type timeseries_container: pandas.DataFrame or dask.DataFrame.

    :param window_length: The size of the window from which the first set of features is extracted.
    :type sub_feature_split: int

    :param feature_timeseries_fc_parameters: mapping from feature calculator names to parameters.
           These are applied to the first set of features generated.
    :type sub_default_fc_parameters: dict

    :param feature_timeseries_kind_to_fc_parameters: apping from kind names to objects of the same type as the ones for
            default_fc_parameters.These are applied to the first set of features generated.
    :type sub_kind_to_fc_parameters: dict

    :param feature_dynamics_fc_parameters: mapping from feature calculator names to parameters. Only those names
           which are keys in this dict will be calculated. See the class:`ComprehensiveFCParameters` for
           more information.
    :type default_fc_parameters: dict

    :param feature_dynamics_kind_to_fc_parameters: mapping from kind names to objects of the same type as the ones for
            default_fc_parameters. If you put a kind as a key here, the fc_parameters
            object (which is the value), will be used instead of the default_fc_parameters. This means that kinds, for
            which kind_of_fc_parameters doe not have any entries, will be ignored by the feature selection.
    :type kind_to_fc_parameters: dict

    :param column_id: The name of the id column to group by. Please see :ref:`data-formats-label`.
    :type column_id: str

    :param column_sort: The name of the sort column. Please see :ref:`data-formats-label`.
    :type column_sort: str

    :param column_kind: The name of the column keeping record on the kind of the value.
            Please see :ref:`data-formats-label`.
    :type column_kind: str

    :param column_value: The name for the column keeping the value itself. Please see :ref:`data-formats-label`.
    :type column_value: str

    :param kwargs: optional keyword arguments passed to `extract_features`.
    :type kwargs: dict

    :return: DataFrame of the extracted feature dynamics.
    :rtype: pandas.DataFrame or dask.DataFrame
